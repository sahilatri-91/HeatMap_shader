# Heat Map shader in Unity

This project demonstrates a heat map simulation created using Shader Programming in Unity. The heat map visualizes varying intensity levels using a gradient of colors, ranging from cool blues to warm reds, representing low to high values. The shaders provide a dynamic and interactive visualization that can be utilized in various applications, especially in game development.

## 🎮 Use in Game Development

Heat maps can be a valuable tool for game developers, offering insights into player behavior and interaction. Common applications include:
- **Analyzing Player Movement:** Visualize areas where players spend most of their time.
- **Gameplay Optimization:** Identify locations with high player interaction to improve level design.
- **Balancing Game Mechanics:** Track how different game zones are used and adjust accordingly.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Unity** - Game development engine
- **Shader Lab** - For creating custom shaders
- **C#** - Scripting language in Unity

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 or later
- Basic understanding of Shader Programming and Unity development

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/sahilatri-91/HeatMap_shader.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Navigate to the scene containing the heat map simulation.

### Running the Simulation

1. Press the "Play" button in Unity to run the simulation.
2. Adjust shader parameters as needed to see changes in real-time.




## 📖 How It Works

The heat map effect is achieved using Unity's Shader Lab to create a custom shader. The shader processes data inputs and generates a color gradient, simulating areas of varying intensity.

1. **Shader Lab** processes the data.
2. **Gradient Colors** indicate intensity levels from low (cool colors) to high (warm colors).
3. **Real-time Updates** ensure dynamic visualization based on changing inputs.

## 🏆 Features

- Dynamic color transitions based on data
- Real-time updates
- Easily adjustable parameters for testing and demonstrations
